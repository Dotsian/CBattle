    "Welcome to CBattle!": (
        "Welcome, soldier, and thank you for installing CBattle! In this package, battling is greatly improved by "
        f"giving {settings.plural_collectible_name} abilities, attack & health stats and even spells! This helpful "
        "tutorial will help you master CBattling, so you wont get left for dead in the arena. You'll learn how to "
        "start a battle, get taught abilities, how to win, making decks and even studying the basics of a fight, so get"
        " ready to brawl in this amazing extension of battling, CBattle!!!"
    ),
    "Starting a Battle": (
        "To initiate a battle, you can type `/battle start`. Click on it, then you will see a parameter asking for what"
        " user you'd like to challenge. Click it, and if you already see them on the list, perfect! Click on them and "
        "send the message. If you dont, search for their user by typing their name in the message bar and clicking "
        "their name. Then, the opponent will get mentioned and once they've arrived, the battle will commence."
    ),
    "All About Decks": (
        f"Decks are the #1 most important thing in CBattling. You know how in {settings.bot_name}, you can catch "
        f"{settings.plural_collectible_name}? Well with decks, you can finally put them to the test! By using "
        f"`/battle add`, you can search and select from your inventory of {settings.plural_collectible_name}. "
        f"Once you've selected them, send the command and you'll see the {settings.plural_collectible_name} pop up in "
        "the embed message! Remember, theres a certain limit of how much there can be in a deck. You can also remove "
        f"{settings.plural_collectible_name}, too, with the `/battle remove` command! Make sure to select the exact "
        f"{settings.collectible_name} you want to remove, though."
    ),
    "Abilities and Such": (
        f"If you've ever seen a {settings.plural_collectible_name} card before, you'd know they have special abilities,"
        " like poison, burst damage, healing and shielding! And yes, in CBattling, this all works! When it is your turn"
        " to fight the opponent's card, you'll have an option to use your ability "
        "(at least if it applies to the abilities logic). Once you've used it, you'll see the card spin, and a message"
        " will pop up over the image, saying: `Example has used Ability: Example Ability!` Most abilites do damage, "
        "so they'd just say it did damage, but it could also say it healed something or gave paralyzation or even one "
        "shot something! I think you get it now!"
    ),
    "Winning and Losing": (
        "Winning and losing. It happens to all of us! But you are a WINNER. If you have all your cards gray, "
        f"unfortunately, you have been defeated, but that doesnt mean give up! Your {settings.plural_collectible_name} "
        "are still alive, so you can fight all you want and train to become the CBattle champion. If all the opponents "
        "cards are gray, however, then congrats, soldier, then you have done it! You are the ultimate warrior! Maybe "
        "you'll earn a cookie. Keep battling other worthy opponents in search of mastering... CBattle!!!"
